# Introduction

The best and worst events in life are often the ones you didn't plan for or went into blindly; and this about sums up my first encounter with Flare-on and actual reverse engineering in general.

Going into this years Flare-on I didn't actually have _any_ practical reversing knowledge. I had touched Ghidra maybe a few times, and had only toyed with some basic binaries for OSCP and its buffer overflow section of the exam. Now, with Flare-on behind me, and doing exponentially better than I could have ever planned, I can say I am looking forward to the next and will try my best to learn and be better prepared for the nex one.

First and foremost, a huge thanks to Yassir a.k.a. [@kladblokje88][kladblokje-twitter], and an unnamed friend which will go by his username mryoranimo who I was doing these challenges with. mryoranimo was a lot more experienced in reversing than me and helped explain things when my simple peanut brain couldn't comprehend something I was seeing. It it weren't for you, I probably wouldn't have made it as far I did.

With the life story behind us, let's dig into this years Flare-on.

# Challenge #1: Flaredle

![Flare-on 9 Flardle challenge description](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-flaredle-challenge-description.webp)

Upon clicking the play live link we're greeted by a Wordle clone as the challenge description hinted at; a Wordle clone in which _a lot_ more characters are required than is normally the case. And this is probably where the "is too hard to beat without cheating" comes in:

![Flare-on 9 Flaredle with two guesses being shown](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-flaredle-overview.webp)

After trying to enter some guesses it seems that it is probably a functional Wordle clone, but due to the length of each guess required it'll be tough to actually guess this; onto the source code instead.

Within `script.js` there's this section of code which checks whether our guess is the correct word:

```js
if (guessString === rightGuessString) {
  let flag = rightGuessString + "@flare-on.com";
  toastr.options.timeOut = 0;
  toastr.options.onclick = function () {
    alert(flag);
  };
  toastr.success("You guessed right! The flag is " + flag);

  guessesRemaining = 0;
  return;
} else {
  guessesRemaining -= 1;
  currentGuess = [];
  nextLetter = 0;

  if (guessesRemaining === 0) {
    toastr.error("You've run out of guesses! Game over!");
    toastr.info(
      'Try reverse engineering the code to discover the correct "word"!'
    );
  }
}
```

Checking the definition of `rightGuessString` shows the following:

```js
let rightGuessString = WORDS[CORRECT_GUESS];
```

With `CORRECT_GUESS` being defined as:

```js
const CORRECT_GUESS = 57;
```

Checking the definition of `WORDS` shows that this is from the `words.js` file also provided:

```js
import { WORDS } from "./words.js";
```

Thus, checking the `words.js` file at line the 57th entry shows the correct word, which is also the only word which contains the word "flare":

```js
export const WORDS = ['acetylphenylhydrazine',
    [snip]
    'establishmentarianism',
    'flareonisallaboutcats',
    'gastroenterocolostomy',
    [snip]
    'zygomaticoauricularis',
	]
```

Entering the word `flareonisallaboutcats` shows that this is the correct answer and shows us the flag:

![Flare-on 9 Flaredle flag returned by correct answer](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-flaredle-wordle-flag.webp)

And with that my first Flare-on challenge was over!

# Challenge #2: Pixel Poker

![Flare-on 9 Pixel Poker description](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-pixel-poker-challenge-description.webp)

Besides the `PixelPoker.exe`, there is also a `readme.txt` which contains the following:

> Welcome to PixelPoker ^\_^, the pixel game that's sweeping the nation!
>
> Your goal is simple: find the correct pixel and click it
>
> Good luck!

Opening the provided `PixelPoker.exe` shows an application window with a seemingly random array of colours where after a few random guesses the following pop-up is shown, informing us we need to try again:

![Flare-on 9 Pixel Poker Womp Womp please play again](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-pixel-poker-womp-womp.webp)

Seeing as the last challenge was inspired by the popular Wordle game, perhaps this took inspiration from [elsewhere][yt-shylilly] ðŸ˜‰.

Jokes aside, this challenge proved _much_ easier than I initially thought-a theme that became relevant down the line-not even requiring me open IDA, Ghidra, et al to solve this.

Opening the `PixelPoker.exe` binary with 7-zip showed a series of directories, including one containing two bitmaps:

![Flare-on 9 Pixel Poker 7-zip showing two bitmaps](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-pixel-poker-binary-bitmaps.webp)

mryoranimo, having dissected the binary in Ghidra noticed there was some code doing XOR on _something_, that's when Yassir compared the two images on [diffchecker.com][diffchecker] and saw the flag at the bottom of the image:

![Flare-on 9 Pixel Poker diffchecker.com with the flag visible](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-pixel-poker-bitmaps-flag.webp)

The barely legible text at the bottom shows the text `w1nN3r_W!NneR_cHick3n_d1nNer@flare-on.com` which is the correct flag for this challenge.

# Challenge #3: Magic 8 Ball

![Flare-on 9 Magic 8 Ball challenge description](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-magic8ball-challenge-description.webp)

Simply starting the challenge binary `Magic8Ball.exe` shows a blue application window, with in it a Magic 8 Ball which we can ask questions to:

![Flare-on 9 Magic 8 Ball challenge binary](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-magic8ball-binary.webp)

Running the Mandiant [FLOSS][gh-floss] tool over the binary gives back some really interesting strings spelling out `gimme flag pls`:

![Flare-on 9 Magic 8 Ball FLOSS output](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-magic8ball-floss-output.webp)

Messing around a bit in IDA, trying to figure out how it even all worked, a series of if else statements can be seen which apparently checked for a letters such as "L", "R", "U", and "D":

![Flare-on 9 IDA showing a series of If Else statements with character codes in them](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-magic8ball-IDA-characters.webp)

This was then decompiled to the following by Ghidra at function `0x4024e0`:

```cpp
    //snip
    if (*(char *)((int)param_1 + 0x159) != '\0') {
    uVar1 = *(uint *)((int)param_1 + 0x124);
    ppcVar4 = this;
    if (0xf < uVar1) {
      ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
    }
    if (*(char *)ppcVar4 == 'L') {
      ppcVar4 = this;
      if (0xf < uVar1) {
        ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
      }
      if (*(char *)((int)ppcVar4 + 1) == 'L') {
        ppcVar4 = this;
        if (0xf < uVar1) {
          ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
        }
        if (*(char *)((int)ppcVar4 + 2) == 'U') {
          ppcVar4 = this;
          if (0xf < uVar1) {
            ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
          }
          if (*(char *)((int)ppcVar4 + 3) == 'R') {
            ppcVar4 = this;
            if (0xf < uVar1) {
              ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
            }
            if (*(char *)(ppcVar4 + 1) == 'U') {
              ppcVar4 = this;
              if (0xf < uVar1) {
                ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
              }
              if (*(char *)((int)ppcVar4 + 5) == 'L') {
                ppcVar4 = this;
                if (0xf < uVar1) {
                  ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
                }
                if (*(char *)((int)ppcVar4 + 6) == 'D') {
                  ppcVar4 = this;
                  if (0xf < uVar1) {
                    ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
                  }
                  if (*(char *)((int)ppcVar4 + 7) == 'U') {
                    ppcVar4 = this;
                    if (0xf < uVar1) {
                      ppcVar4 = (char **)*this;
                    }
                    if (*(char *)(ppcVar4 + 2) == 'L') {
                      _Str1 = (undefined4 *)((int)param_1 + 0xf8);
                      if (0xf < *(uint *)((int)param_1 + 0x10c)) {
                        _Str1 = (undefined4 *)*_Str1;
                      }
                      iVar2 = strncmp((char *)_Str1,(char *)((int)param_1 + 0x5c),0xf);
                      if (iVar2 == 0) {
                        FUN_00401220(&stack0xffffffc0,this);
                        FUN_00401a10(param_1,in_stack_ffffffc0);
                      }
                      // snip
```

Putting the entire chain into order shows the following pattern: `L L U R U L D U L`.

Me and mryoranimo tried to enter the pattern and then the "gimme flag pls?" string into the Magic 8 Ball, and vice versa to no avail. It was only the next day, doing it all again that it somehow worked this time; ain't that fun ðŸ« .

Doing the shuffle with the pattern, entering the phrase `gimme flag pls?` and pressing enter ~~finally~~ returned the flag:

# Challenge #4: darn_mice

![Flare-on 9 darn_mice challenge description](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-darnmice-challenge-description.webp)

Simply running the binary does nothing and just returns:

![Flare-on 9 darn_mice binary output with no input](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-darnmice-binary-noinput.webp)

Entering a random input returns an output stating "On your plate, you see four olives. You leave the room, and a mouse EATS one!"

![Flare-on 9 darn_mice binary output with random input](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-darnmice-binary-random-input.webp)

However, giving an input that is 36 characters or greater will show a different input: "On your plate, you see four olives. No, nevermind"

![Flare-on 9 darn_mice 36 character input](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-darnmice-binary-36-character-input.webp)

I did notice some strange behaviour when only entering the letter "s". The binary returned a new string `nibble...` and then `When you return, you only: s` followed by a seemingly random string of characters:

![Flare-on 9 darn_mice binary output with "s" as input](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-darnmice-s-input.webp)

This strange behaviour later turned out to be the correct path to solving this challenge. What I didn't yet understand at the the time was the reason _why_ this character in particular triggered this.

The awnser to the behaviour would later be found in the function at address `0x40100` that first contained an array of 36 bytes. The second is a function that does an addition of the current index item from the 36 byte array + the given input on the command-line, and then executes that:

```cpp
void __cdecl FUN_00401000(PUCHAR param_1)
// snip

// array of 36 bytes
  byte_array[0] = 'P';
  byte_array[1] = 0x5e;
  byte_array[2] = 0x5e;
  byte_array[3] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[4] = 0x4f;
  byte_array[5] = 0x5b;
  byte_array[6] = 0x51;
  byte_array[7] = 0x5e;
  byte_array[8] = 0x5e;
  byte_array[9] = 0x97;
  byte_array[10] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[11] = 0x80;
  byte_array[12] = 0x90;
  byte_array[13] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[14] = 0x80;
  byte_array[15] = 0x90;
  byte_array[16] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[17] = 0x80;
  byte_array[18] = 0x90;
  byte_array[19] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[20] = 0x80;
  byte_array[21] = 0x90;
  byte_array[22] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[23] = 0x80;
  byte_array[24] = 0x90;
  byte_array[25] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[26] = 0x80;
  byte_array[27] = 0x90;
  byte_array[28] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[29] = 0x80;
  byte_array[30] = 0x90;
  byte_array[31] = 0xa2;
  byte_array[32] = 0xa3;
  byte_array[33] = 0x6b;
  byte_array[34] = 0x7f;
  byte_array[35] = 0;

  // snip
  sVar1 = _strlen((char *)param_1);
  uVar3 = SUB41(pcVar4,0);
  if ((sVar1 == 0) || (0x23 < sVar1)) {
    FUN_00401240((wchar_t *)s_No,_nevermind._0041905c);
    uVar2 = extraout_DL;
  }
  else {
    FUN_00401240((wchar_t *)s_You_leave_the_room,_and_a_mouse_E_0041906c);
    for (local_30 = 0;
        ((uVar3 = SUB41(pcVar4,0), local_30 < 0x24 && (byte_array[local_30] != '\0')) &&
        (param_1[local_30] != '\0')); local_30 = local_30 + 1) {
      pcVar4 = (code *)VirtualAlloc((LPVOID)0x0,0x1000,0x3000,0x40);
      *pcVar4 = (code)(byte_array[local_30] + param_1[local_30]);
      (*pcVar4)();
      FUN_00401240((wchar_t *)s_Nibble..._00419098);

    FUN_00401240((wchar_t *)&DAT_004190cc);
    uVar2 = extraout_DL_00;
  }
```

What appears to happen here is that after `pcVar4` is formed from an addition of the array index + whatever our input was it is then executed as legitimate code. Now, the significance of the letter "s" here is that this is the equivalent of `0xC3` or 195 in decimal which is the OP code for `RET` or return from this addition.

|        |          |                                  |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Opcode | Mnemonic | Description                      |
| C3     | RET      | Near return to calling procedure |
| CB     | RET      | Far return to calling procedure  |

> Transfers program control to a return address located on the top of the stack. The address is usually placed on the stack by a CALL instruction, and the return is made to the instruction that follows the CALL instruction.

_Source: [c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_280][x86-ret]_

Since the `RET` operation doesn't actually do much and would probably crash when given most other op codes the challenge description of "If it crashes its user error." and the returned text of "when you return you only:" makes sens. To loop through the entire array we need to make sure that each addition forms this `C3` / `RET` OP code so that it doesn't crash.

To achieve the above, I used a simple Cyberchef formula that took a string of C3s-our desired outcome-and subtracted that with each item in the array. This then returned the following:

![Flare-on 9 darn_mice Cyberchef formula](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-darnmice-cyberchef-formula.webp)

With this formula the magic string we need to enter to have everything return `C3` / `RET` is `see three, C3 C3 C3 C3 C3 C3 C3! XD`. Entering this into the challenge binary spits out the very fitting flag of `i_w0uld_l1k3_to_RETurn_this_joke@flare-on.com`:

![Flare-on 9 darn_mice flag output](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-darnmice-flag-output.webp)

# Challenge #5: T8

![Flare-on 9 T8 challenge description](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-challenge-description.webp)

First off, _ouch_. Second, this challenge started off strong with a binary that was programed to sleep for a period fo 432.000.000 seconds:

![Flare-on 9 T8 sleep syscall](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-sleep-syscall.webp)

![Flare-on 9 T8 sleep syscall assembly view](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-sleep-syscall-assembly.webp)

As can be seen by my comment, the sleep syscall here didn't do much for the program itself, and can thus be patched out by changing the OP code to a `JMP` from a `JZ` instead:

![Flare-on 9 T8 patched sleep syscall assembly view](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-patched-sleep-syscall-assembly.webp)

However, with this patched sleep I wasn't able to get much further. Looking at the code following this showed a series of `uStack` variable containing some hex with `0x00` between them. These turned out to be a `wchar_t[16]` array as Windows uses UTF-16, rather than 8 making any UTF-8 string a series of characters with `0x00` to pad the length to the next character.

Doing this type change changed the data from the following to a neat `uStack72` array which I later renamed to `possible_domain` as it contained `flareon.com` in the name:

Original `uStack` array:

![Flare-on 9 ustack array before any changes](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-ustack-raw.webp)

`uStack` array changed to `wchar_t[16]` and renamed to `possible_domain`:

![Flare-on 9 ustack array after changing types to wchar_t[16] in ghidra](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-ustack-renamed-new-type.webp)

How I managed to get `flareon.com` from this was a hint below this array that did an XOR operation over these values.

The `straight_up_eight` value is decremented by 2 and uses that as its array index and does an XOR 17 operation over it. Doing this operation in Cyberchef with the string `0x7c007e0072003f` showed a string of `.com`:

![Flare-on 9 XOR 17 recipe in Cyberchef](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-xor17-domain.webp)

This is where I / we were stuck for a while. Messing around with the binary and the PCAPs it would create, it seemed that the PCAP showed random numbers for each POST request. This number generation was then tied to this function at `FUN_00421ff4`:

![Flare-on 9 UA number generator](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-ua-number-generator.webp)

Looking up those two hex values as their decimal counter parts (214013 & 2531011 respectively) returned a hit by Wikipedia for a linear congruential generator with the following table of parameters in use:

|                              |                |                |               |                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

_Source: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator][wiki-lcg]_

Patching this function to always return the value from the PCAP (11950) makes this function look the following:

In an effort to perfectly simulate the PCAP given by the challenge, Yassir wrote the following Python script for an HTTP server:

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
import time

class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    sys_version = ""
    server_version = "Apache On 9 "
    def date_time_string(self,timestamp=0):
        return "Tue, 14 Jun 2022 16:14:36 GMT"
    def do_POST(self):
        if "; CLR" in str(self.headers):
            print("Request 2")
            message = "F1KFlZbNGuKQxrTD/ORwudM8S8kKiL5F906YlR8TKd8XrKPeDYZ0HouiBamyQf9/Ns7u3C2UEMLoCA0B8EuZp1FpwnedVjPSdZFjkieYqWzKA7up+LYe9B4dmAUM2lYkmBSqPJYT6nEg27n3X656MMOxNIHt0HsOD0d+"
        else:
            print("Request 1")
            message = "TdQdBRa1nxGU06dbB27E7SQ7TJ2+cd7zstLXRQcLbmh2nTvDm1p5IfT/Cu0JxShk6tHQBRWwPlo9zA1dISfslkLgGDs41WK12ibWIflqLE4Yq3OYIEnLNjwVHrjL2U4Lu3ms+HQc4nfMWXPgcOHb4fhokk93/AJd5GTuC5z+4YsmgRh1Z90yinLBKB+fmGUyagT6gon/KHmJdvAOQ8nAnl8K/0XG+8zYQbZRwgY6tHvvpfyn9OXCyuct5/cOi8KWgALvVHQWafrp8qB/JtT+t5zmnezQlp3zPL4sj2CJfcUTK5copbZCyHexVD4jJN+LezJEtrDXP1DJNg=="
        self.protocol_version = "HTTP/1.0"
        self.send_response(200)
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes(message, "utf8"))
        return
def run():
    server = ('', 80)
    httpd = HTTPServer(server, RequestHandler)
    httpd.serve_forever()
run()
```

Running the binary now shows a pop-up saying "You're a machine!!!" in the form of a Fatal Application Exit:

![Flare-on 9 T8 application error](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-application-error.webp)

And this is where we then got stuck again for a _long_ time trying to figure out what the binary was doing after it received the Base-64 string from the server.

It turned out, that this was all you had to do to get the flag. The flag was hidden somewhere in the application memory when it ran and triggered the exception, all you had to do was look for it:

![Flare-on 9 t8 challenge flag in binary memory](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-t8-flag-in-memory.webp)

# Challenge #6: Ã  la mode

![Flare-on 9 alamode challenge description](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-challenge-description.webp)

At first glance this was a pure .NET challenge for which you had to perhaps develop some of your own code as the section that did something with the flag was missing:

![Flare-on 9 alamode dnspy overview](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-dnspy.webp)

And the empty flag section:

The other section of this challenge, and how I solved it, was dissecting the binary inside Ghidra and figuring out what was being done in it.

First, the function named `dllmain_dispatch` at `0x100016e4` makes a call to the function `FUN_10001163`:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Ghidra dllmain_dispatch](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-ghidra-main.webp)

`FUN10001163` makes a call to renamed function `FUN_100012f1` -> `FUN_all_available_functions_list` if there are two parameters:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Ghidra call to function index](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-ghidra-call-to-index.webp)

This `FUN_100012f1` contains a list of definitions and calls to similar functions that, at first, appear to be obfuscated / not legible:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Ghidra function index overview](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-ghidra-function-index.webp)

When checking any of the `FUN_100014ae` functions it becomes clear that the input is processed with XOR 17:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Ghidra XOR 17 function FUN_100014ae](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-ghidra-xor17-function.webp)

We can now decode all these weird char strings with XOR 17 in Cyberchef to get the original name for these functions:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Cyberchef XOR 17 formula](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-cyberchef-xor17.webp)

Doing this for all the names changes `FUN_100014ae` to look the following:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Ghidra changed function names FUN_100014ae](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-ghidra-decoded-names.webp)

The following hours I spent renaming variables in various functions according to Microsoft documentation to match their originals.

In the end, the function and sub-functions of value were stored at `FUN_1000100` renamed as `FUN_processes_buffer` containing the following code:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Ghidra buffer processor code of FUN_1000100](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-ghidra-buffer-processor.webp)

The first named function `FUN_init_substitution_table` or `FUN_100011ef` contained the following code that sets the substitution table for the crypto algorithm:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Ghidra init substitution table code](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-ghidra-init-sub-table.webp)

And a `FUN_decrypt` function that took the contents of the buffer and decrypted them, using the state reached by the substitution table:

![Flare-on 9 alamode Ghidra decrypt function](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-ghidra-decrypt.webp)

There were now two ways of solving this, either patching enough of the binary to run it and somehow get the password out of it. Or, option two: rewriting the functions this binary did to decode the buffer and the return us the contents. This is exactly what I did as it seemed easier ~~little did I know that writing C++ from a decompiled source sucks~~.

In the end, with some help from mryoranimo explaining compiler errors, I used the following C++ code to solve this challenge, emulating its actions and not having to check for a password at all:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdint>

/*

int main() {
    uint8_t ARRAY_8bytes[8] = { 0x55, 0x8b, 0xec, 0x83, 0xec, 0x20, 0xeb, 0xfe, };

    uint8_t table[258] = { 0 };

    printf("FLAREON9 - challenge #6 a la mode\n\n");

    table[0] = 0;
    table[1] = 0;

    offset = 0;

    do {
        table[offset + 2] = offset;
        table[offset + 2 + 1] = offset + 1;
        table[offset + 2 + 2] = offset + 2;

	iVar2 = 0;

    offset = 0;

	do {

	}

	table[0] = uVar4;
	table[1] = local_4;

	printf("encryption password: %s\n\n", dest);

	i = 0;
	local_4 = table[1];
	uVar4 = table[0];

	if (0 < 0x1f) {

			uVar1 = table[uVar4 + 2];
			cVar3 = (char)uVar1;
			local_4 = (uint8_t) ((char) uVar1 + (char)local_4);
			uVar2 = table[local_4 + 2];
			table[uVar4 + 2] = uVar2;
			table[local_4 + 2] = uVar1;
			flag[i] = flag[i] ^ table[(uint8_t)(cVar3 + (char) uVar2) + 2];
			i = i + 1;
		} while (i < 0x1f);
	}

	table[0] = uVar4;
	table[1] = local_4;

    printf("flag:\n");
	for (i = 0; i < 0x1f; i++) {
		printf("%c", flag[i]);
	}
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

Then compiling this with `cl /EHsc main.cpp` and running it showed both the password, and the flag:

![Flare-on 9 alamode challenge flag output](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-alamode-challenge-flag.webp)

I would later find out that the challenge name is a reference to [mixed mode assembly][ms-mm-assembly], which was a programming concept I hadn't come across until then.

# Challenge #7: anode

![Flare-on 9 anode challenge description](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-anode-challenge-description.webp)

This challenge really did my head in for a while as it was a crypto challenge where one had to reverse a series of mutations done by the encryption. Cryptography is a field that fascinates me, but my peanut brain has trouble grasping some of the math involved in it.

At first there was a _big_ binary that took a while for Ghidra to process; its size was 54 **M**B. Capital M for Mega.

![Flare-on 9 anode big boy binary](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-anode-challenge-binary-size.webp)

When running the binary it asked for a flag, and would return `try again` when the flag wasn't valid, I assume.

![Flare-on 9 anode binary output](/images/CTF/flareon9/flareon9-anode-binary-output.webp)

Running `FLOSS` over the binary returned an error that there were too many lines for `FLOSS` to process; a good indicator of what was to come later down the line. Within the output of `FLOSS` the following JavaScript could be seen handling the flag you entered into it:

```js
readline.question(`Enter flag: `, flag => {
  readline.close();
  if (flag.length !== 44) {
    console.log("Try again.");
    process.exit(0);
  var b = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < flag.length; i++) {
    b.push(flag.charCodeAt(i));
  // something strange is happening...
  if (1n) {
    console.log("uh-oh, math is too correct...");
    process.exit(0);
  var state = 1337;
  while (true) {
    state ^= Math.floor(Math.random() * (2**30));
    switch (state) {
      case 306211:
        if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
          b[30] -= b[34] + b[23] + b[5] + b[37] + b[33] + b[12] + Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
          b[30] &= 0xFF;
        } else {
          b[26] -= b[24] + b[41] + b[13] + b[43] + b[6] + b[30] + 225;
          b[26] &= 0xFF;
        }
        state = 868071080;
        continue;
      case 311489:
        if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
          b[10] -= b[32] + b[1] + b[20] + b[30] + b[23] + b[9] + 115;
          b[10] &= 0xFF;
        } else {
          b[7] ^= (b[18] + b[14] + b[11] + b[25] + b[31] + b[21] + 19) & 0xFF;
        }
        state = 22167546;
        continue;
      case 755154:
```

With the above JavaScript we can now deduct that the flag needs to be 44 characters in length to pass the initial check, but we also need to patch it as it will just exit with how it is now.

mryoranimo and his [galaxy-brain][gbrain] spent that evening reading the Nexe compiler documentation and eventually made a Python script via which we would be able replace the user code section of the `anode.exe` binary and replace it with whatever JavaScript we wanted:

Usage:

```
Usage: ./patch.py anode.exe resource.js anode-new.exe
```

Python script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import os
import struct
from math import floor

FOOTER_STRUCT = "<dd"
FOOTER_STRUCT_SZ = struct.calcsize(FOOTER_STRUCT)

FOOTER_MAGIC = b"<nexe~~sentinel>"

def main(args):
    infile = args[0]
    patchfile = args[1]
    outfile = args[2]

    infile_sz = os.path.getsize(infile)

    with open(infile, "rb") as infile_stream:
        infile_stream.seek(infile_sz - FOOTER_STRUCT_SZ)
        content_sz, resource_sz = [ floor(x) for x in struct.unpack_from(FOOTER_STRUCT, infile_stream.read()) ]

        # seek back to the packed footer
        infile_stream.seek(0 - len(FOOTER_MAGIC) - FOOTER_STRUCT_SZ, os.SEEK_CUR)

        # from there, seek back to the beginning of the content payload
        infile_stream.seek(0 - (content_sz + resource_sz), os.SEEK_CUR)

        # now we can read both the content and resource payloads
        content_buf = infile_stream.read(content_sz)
        resource_buf = infile_stream.read(resource_sz)

    print("Content size: {}".format(content_sz))
    print("Resource size: {}".format(resource_sz))

    print("Retrieved content size: {}".format(len(content_buf)))
    print("Retrieved resource size: {}".format(len(resource_buf)))

    with open(patchfile, "rb") as patchfile_stream:
        patch = patchfile_stream.read()

    with open(outfile, "wb") as outfile_stream:
        with open(infile, "rb") as infile_stream:
            remainder = infile_sz - content_sz - resource_sz - len(FOOTER_MAGIC) - FOOTER_STRUCT_SZ
            while remainder > 0:
                buf = infile_stream.read(min(remainder, 8192 * 1024))
                outfile_stream.write(buf)
                remainder -= len(buf)
                print(remainder)

        patch_sz = len(patch)
        content_buf = content_buf.replace(str(resource_sz).encode(), str(patch_sz).encode())
        outfile_stream.write(content_buf)
        outfile_stream.write(patch)
        outfile_stream.write(FOOTER_MAGIC)
        outfile_stream.write(struct.pack(FOOTER_STRUCT, len(content_buf), patch_sz))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv[1:])
```

Another thing that could be deducted from the JavaScript is that the PRNG used in this binary is probably seeded, and will thus always produce the same results with the same inputs. This because the JavaScript contains cases for the math either being "too correct" or "math.random() is too random"

mryoranimo explained that it it would now be possible to revert the mutations done by the binary if we'd get all the mutations that it did in order, and then walked those back. In order to get all the states the binary went through was as simple as changing the JavaScript case code from actually executing anything to merely printing it to STDOUT.

Going from this:

```js
switch (state) {
    case 306211:
        if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
            b[30] -= b[34] + b[23] + b[5] + b[37] + b[33] + b[12] + Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
            b[30] &= 0xFF;
        } else {
            b[26] -= b[24] + b[41] + b[13] + b[43] + b[6] + b[30] + 225;
            b[26] &= 0xFF;
        }
        state = 868071080;
        continue;
```

To now this:

```js
switch (state) {
      case 306211:
        if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
          statestring += "b[30] -= b[34] + b[23] + b[5] + b[37] + b[33] + b[12] " + Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
          statestring += "b[30] &= 0xFF;"
        } else {
          statestring += "b[26] -= b[24] + b[41] + b[13] + b[43] + b[6] + b[30] + 225";
          statestring += "b[26] &= 0xFF;"
        }
        state = 868071080;
        continue;
```

To do this for all 1024 states was done via some Regex magic `^(\s+)(b[\d+].*;)$` and substituting it with `$1state_transition_string += "$2";`. For the remaining substitutions a simple find-and-replace `Math.floor(Math.random() * 256` with `" + Math.floor(Math.random() * 256) + "` would suffice. Now running the binary in a terminal returned the following:

```
LARE 10/15/2022 7:38:41 PM

[snip]
b[22] += b[16] + b[18] + b[7] + b[23] + b[1] + b[27] + 50;b[22] &= 0xFF;b[39] += b[18] + b[16] + b[8] + b[19] + b[5] + b[23] + 36;b[39] &= 0xFF;
Try again.
```

Leaving us with about 1700 odd lines of JavaScript we need to reverse the order of, that looked a little like this:

```js
b[29] -= b[37] + b[23] + b[22] + b[24] + b[26] + b[10] + 7;
b[29] &= 0xff;
b[39] += b[34] + b[2] + b[1] + b[43] + b[20] + b[9] + 79;
b[39] &= 0xff;
b[19] ^= (b[26] + b[0] + b[40] + b[37] + b[23] + b[32] + 255) & 0xff;
b[28] ^= (b[1] + b[23] + b[37] + b[31] + b[43] + b[42] + 245) & 0xff;
b[39] += b[42] + b[10] + b[3] + b[41] + b[14] + b[26] + 177;
b[39] &= 0xff;
b[9] -= b[20] + b[19] + b[22] + b[5] + b[32] + b[35] + 151;
b[9] &= 0xff;
b[14] -= b[4] + b[5] + b[31] + b[15] + b[36] + b[40] + 67;
b[14] &= 0xff;
b[33] += b[25] + b[12] + b[14] + b[34] + b[4] + b[36] + 185;
b[33] &= 0xff;
```

Reversing the document itself was easy with `tac`. Reversing the math done in the document took a _little while longer_.

Say we have the following mutation that is done last:

```js
b[39] &= 0xff;
b[39] += b[18] + b[16] + b[8] + b[19] + b[5] + b[23] + 36;
```

This can be changed to the following to do the math in reverse order:

```js
b[39] = ((211 + 106 + 66 + 68 + 102 + 38 + 36) & 255)
b[39] += 627 & 255
212 = (x + 627) & 255
x = 112 ( 627 & 255 = 100) ((100 +112) & 255 = 212)
```

To then do this for all the 1024 or so cases can be done with the following two regex patterns:

```
  # flip - with +
  search: ^(b\[\d+\]) -= (.*);$
  replace: $1 = ($1 + ($2)) & 255;

  # flip + with -
  search: ^(b\[\d+\]) += (.*);$
  replace: $1 = ($1 - ($2)) & 255;
```

Which creates something a little like this:

```js
b[39] = (b[39] - (b[18] + b[16] + b[8] + b[19] + b[5] + b[23] + 36)) & 255;
b[22] = (b[22] - (b[16] + b[18] + b[7] + b[23] + b[1] + b[27] + 50)) & 255;
b[34] = (b[34] - (b[35] + b[40] + b[13] + b[41] + b[23] + b[25] + 14)) & 255;
b[21] = (b[21] - (b[39] + b[6] + b[0] + b[33] + b[8] + b[40] + 179)) & 255;
b[11] = (b[11] + (b[32] + b[8] + b[9] + b[34] + b[39] + b[19] + 185)) & 255;
b[19] ^= (b[0] + b[35] + b[14] + b[30] + b[21] + b[33] + 213) & 0xff;
b[40] = (b[40] - (b[13] + b[3] + b[43] + b[31] + b[22] + b[25] + 49)) & 255;
b[17] ^= (b[41] + b[14] + b[43] + b[6] + b[7] + b[28] + 196) & 0xff;
```

Putting this into a JavaScript program looked the following:

```js
var b = [
  106, 196, 106, 178, 174, 102, 31, 91, 66, 255, 86, 196, 74, 139, 219, 166,
  106, 4, 211, 68, 227, 72, 156, 38, 239, 153, 223, 225, 73, 171, 51, 4, 234,
  50, 207, 82, 18, 111, 180, 212, 81, 189, 73, 76,
];
b[39] = (b[39] - (b[18] + b[16] + b[8] + b[19] + b[5] + b[23] + 36)) & 255;
b[22] = (b[22] - (b[16] + b[18] + b[7] + b[23] + b[1] + b[27] + 50)) & 255;
b[34] = (b[34] - (b[35] + b[40] + b[13] + b[41] + b[23] + b[25] + 14)) & 255;
b[21] = (b[21] - (b[39] + b[6] + b[0] + b[33] + b[8] + b[40] + 179)) & 255;

# Challenge #8: Backdoor

From my time spent on Twitter lurking at what others had to mention about the challenges, it seemed that challenge #8 was going to be the hardest one of the bunch. This turned out be correct as neither I, mryoranimo, nor Yassir were able to solve this in time.

I didn't actually look at this challenge very much, as at the time when we got to it I lost a bit of motivation to work on _only_ Flare-on day-in-and-out.

# Conclusions

All in all. I made it _way_ further than I could have ever dreamed of going into flare-on pretty much blind without any prior experience. Battling my way through the 7 challenges that I managed to complete felt very rewarding after finally getting it and understanding the challenge name or the thing I was staring at for the last _n_ hours. With this positive experience behind me, I am looking forward to what next years Flare-on has in store for me. ~~hopefully less JavaScript~~
